In order to know your device name and/or the IP address press for at least half a second the BOOT button and check the display.

As alternative method you can use the IP address. If you are using the AP mode the IP address is always `192.168.4.1` and the connection address is `http://192.168.4.1` for everyone.

There is no credentials to connect to web user interface. Device name and credentials to connect to web user interface can be changed in the Options page.
