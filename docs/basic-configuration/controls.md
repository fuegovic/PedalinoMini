## Controls

Controls represent individual switches or inputs on a pedal - for example, the second button on pedal 4 would be considered one control.

All actions in PedalinoMini are triggered by controls, which means that every input source (including analog pedals) must be configured as a control to function properly.

**Hardware Note:** Due to technical limitations, simultaneous presses cannot be detected when using two switches on the same `LADDER` pedal. However, you can successfully use simultaneous presses between switches on different pedals of any type.

Each control can be assigned a default LED number, creating a logical link between the physical switch and its visual indicator. This feature simplifies hardware wiring while maintaining an organized relationship between controls and their status indicators.
